    Such a software is Toporobot / Limelight, which files are well known.
    The goal of this plug-in it to import those file in a GIS.
    The cave extend can then be viewed along with a terrain map or with geological information.
    Together with the geographic information, some information such as the cave name, gallery name, point number and the date of survey are recorded.
    If a digital elevation model is available and given, the depth of each points in the cave is computed.
